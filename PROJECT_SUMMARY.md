### 📊 Sample Workflow Demonstration

#### Input
```
Audio: "Good morning doctor. I've been having chest pain since last night.
It started around 10 PM and it's been bothering me. The pain is sharp
and comes and goes. Sometimes it's worse when I take a deep breath."
```

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Speech Recognition**: Whisper converts audio to text (85% confidence)
2. **Entity Extraction**: Identifies "chest pain" (symptom), "sharp pain" (descriptor)
3. **SOAP Generation**: Creates structured clinical note
4. **Export**: PDF/JSON download available

#### Output
```
SOAP NOTE
=========
SUBJECTIVE:
Chief Complaint: Chest pain since last night
Patient reports sharp chest pain that started around 10 PM yesterday.
Pain is intermittent and worsens with deep breathing.

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs: [To be documented during exam]

ASSESSMENT:
• Rule out angina/coronary artery disease
• Consider musculoskeletal chest pain

PLAN:
• Order ECG
• Follow-up if symptoms worsen
```

### 🚀 Deployment Options
